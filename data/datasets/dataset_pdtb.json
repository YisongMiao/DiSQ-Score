The downgrades were prompted, Moody's said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock. Moody's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position.  "

Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell. The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 to as high as $471.60, and the more deferred positions, due to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60. On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close. Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that. One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. \"What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened,\" said Mr. Cardillo. There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said. He expects a drop in interest rates, which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising. Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today. This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said.  "

        "context": "ENERGY: Worried that Friday's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices. The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $20.59 a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents. Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains. But most market observers agreed that Friday's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday. Until yesterday, futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand. So any bearish indicator, such as Friday's precipitous drop in the stock market, sends shivers through the oil markets as well. Indeed, after reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday.  "

        "context": "PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, first falling and then later rising. Silver performed quietly. The spot October gold price rose $4 to $367.30 an ounce. The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 an ounce at $371.20, after trading as high as $374. December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.163. Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal, easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy, but recovering later, as the stock market strengthened. Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday. For one thing, last Friday, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive, so it couldn't react to it. Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell. The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 to as high as $471.60, and the more deferred positions, due to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60. On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close. Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that. One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. \"What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened,\" said Mr. Cardillo. There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said. He expects a drop in interest rates, which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising. Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today. This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said.  "

India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more, the analyst said. Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market. \"India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices,\" said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York. At any rate, she added, \"India needs the sugar, so it will be in sooner or later to buy it.\"  "
